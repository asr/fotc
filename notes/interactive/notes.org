* To add: Martin-Löf cite
From Peter:
Just a note. In one of Per Martin-Löf's first papers on
type theory he explicitly writes down translations of a number of well
known theories into type theory, including a translation of first
order intuitionistic predicate logic using Curry-Howard. This might
actually be useful to look at, and to cite.
* Using reflection.

<Ulf: magic function Set → FOL is hopeless. reflection is so much
better>
