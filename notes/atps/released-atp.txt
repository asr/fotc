When there is a new release of an ATP, we should follow the following
procedure:

(See apia/notes/atps/run-atps.txt for running the ATPs)

* Test fotc/notes/atps/mendelson-equality.

* In fotc/src/fot, to test all the proved conjectures if the ATP is a
  default one.

* In fotc/notes, to test all the proved conjectures if the ATP is a
  default one.

* In fotc/src/fot, to test the ATPs failures and to update the date:

    find -name 'UnprovedATP.agda'

* In fotc/notes, to test the ATPs failures and to update the date:

    find -name '*.agda' | xargs grep 'The ATPs could not'

* Search for comments using the old version, i.e. something like

    find -name '*' | xargs grep -I 'old version' | sort
