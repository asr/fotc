Agsy examples
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains the Agsy examples. Agsy requires the equality
reasoning from the Agda standard library, therefore we use it. In
addition, the option -m include the constants in scope only in the
innermost module surrounding the current hole, therefore we avoid to
import modules in the Agsy examples.

The current holes in the modules mean that Agsy could not complete the
proof.
